abstract = {A survey is an empirical research strategy for the collection of information from heterogeneous sources. In this way, survey results often exhibit a high degree of external validity. It is complementary to other empirical research strategies such as controlled experiments, which usually have their strengths in the high internal validity of the findings. While there is a growing number of (quasi-)controlled experiments reported in the software engineering literature, few results of large scale surveys have been reported there. Hence, there is still a lack of knowledge on how to use surveys in a systematic manner for software engineering empirical research. This chapter introduces a process for preparing, conducting, and analyzing a software engineering survey. The focus of the work is on questionnaire-based surveys rather than literature surveys. The survey process is driven by practical experiences from two large-scale efforts in the review and inspection area. There are two main results from this work. First, the process itself allows researchers in empirical software engineering to follow a systematic, disciplined approach. Second, the experiences from applying the process help avoid common pitfalls that endanger both the research process and its results. We report on two (descriptive) surveys on software reviews that applied the survey process, and we present our experiences, as well as models for survey effort and duration factors derived from these experiences. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2003.},

abstract = {A survey can characterize the knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors of a large group of people through the study of a subset of them. However, to protect the validity of conclusions drawn from a survey, certain procedures must be followed throughout the process of designing, developing, and distributing the survey questionnaire. Surveys are used extensively by software and systems engineering organizations to provide insight into complex issues, assist with problem solving, and support effective decision making. This document presents a seven-stage, end-to-end process for conducting a survey.},

abstract = {Background: Survey is a method of research aiming to gather data from a large population of interest. Despite being extensively used in software engineering, survey-based research faces several challenges, such as selecting a representative population sample and designing the data collection instruments. Objective: This article aims to summarize the existing guidelines, supporting instruments and recommendations on how to conduct and evaluate survey-based research. Methods: A systematic search using manual search and snowballing techniques were used to identify primary studies supporting survey research in software engineering. We used an annotated review to present the findings, describing the references of interest in the research topic. Results: The summary provides a description of 15 available articles addressing the survey methodology, based upon which we derived a set of recommendations on how to conduct survey research, and their impact in the community. Conclusion: Survey-based research in software engineering has its particular challenges, as illustrated by several articles in this review. The annotated review can contribute by raising awareness of such challenges and present the proper recommendations to overcome them.},
